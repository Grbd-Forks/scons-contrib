SCons - a software construction tool contrib repo
#################################################

Welcome to the SCons contrib repo.  The real purpose of this tree is to
provide a place for contributed builders and other useful logic.
Previously many such files were posted to the wiki but that's not
very functional.

Please create a directory per contribution.
We may re-organize if it becomes obvious that doing so would 
make it easier for users to find useful logic.
